# Mask detection using Convolutional Neural Network with Alert Sound
Mask detection
Face mask detection refers to detect whether a person is wearing a mask or not. In 
fact, the problem is reverse engineering of face detection where the face is detected using different 
machine learning algorithms for the purpose of security, authentication and 
surveillance. Recognition from faces is a popular and significant technology in recent years. Face 
alterations and the presents of different masks make it too much challenging. In the real-world, 
when a person is uncooperative with the systems such as in video then masking is further common 
scenarios. For these masks, current face recognition performance degrades. An abundant number 
of researches work has been performed for recognizing faces under different conditions like 
changing pose or illumination, degraded images, etc. Still, difficulties created by masks are usually 
disregarded. The primary concern to this work is about facial masks, and especially to enhance the 
recognition accuracy of different masked faces. A feasible approach has been proposed that 
consists of first detecting the facial regions. The occluded face detection problem has been 
approached using OpenCv and Convolution Neural Network (CNN). Experiments signify that this 
mentioned approach gives a remarkable performance on masked face recognition. Besides, its 
performance has been also evaluated within excessive facial masks are found attractive outcomes. 
Finally, co relates so made here for a better understanding. The impact of COVID-19 has been 
fallen on almost all sector of development. The health care system is going through a crisis. Many 
precautionary measures have been taken to reduce the spread of this disease where wearing a mask 
is one of them. We propose a system that restricts the growth of COVID-19 by finding out people 
who are not wearing any facial mask in a smart city network where all the public places are 
monitored with closed circuit television (CCTV) cameras. While a person without a mask is 
detected, the corresponding authorities are informed through the city network.
 A deep learning architecture is trained on a dataset that consists of images of people with 
and without mask collected from various sources. Thus, a new deep learning (DL) fusion model is 
proposed, which includes object detection and semantic segmentation. It can solve the problems 
of end face localization and segmentation of steel bar at the same time. It is crucial to detect 
manipulated face images and localize manipulated regions. Instead of simple using multi-task 
learning to simultaneously detect manipulated images and predict the manipulated mask (regions), 
we propose to utilize an attention mechanism to process and improve the feature maps for the 
3
classification task. COVID-19 pandemic has rapidly affected our day-to-day life disrupting the 
world trade and movements.
Wearing a protective face mask has become a new normal. In the near future, many public service 
providers will ask the customers to wear masks correctly to avail of their services. Therefore, face 
mask detection has become a crucial task to help global society. This project presents a simplified 
approach to achieve this purpose using some basic Machine Learning package like Tensor Flow, 
Keras, OpenCv, Scipy, Matplotlip,Imutils, pygame and Numpy packages. Pygame package is used 
for alert sound. The proposed method detects the face from the image correctly and then identifies 
if it has a mask on it or not. As a surveillance task performer, it can also detect a face along with a 
mask in motion. The method attains highest accuracy in with mask 99.98% and Without mask 
99.99% respectively on two different datasets. We explore optimized values of parameters using 
the Sequential Convolution Neural Network model to detect the presence of masks correctly 
without causing over-fitting
